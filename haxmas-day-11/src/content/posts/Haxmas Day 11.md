# At the beginning
At first, it was a little hard but eventually I figured it out and decided to ditch Tailwind.<br>
I remember doing a workshop very similar to this but gave up because of all the linking that needed to be done in the top with the three "-\--"s.<br>
I still very much enjoyed this workshop. End product looks ___sweeet___. Really good YSWS.

# Adding little tweaks
* I decided to change the font and the CSS for the posts index.
* Centered images and text
* Added rounded corners and a nice white background
* Edited colors
* Added back to posts button
* Added back to home button
* Added custom favicon
* Added page titles
